# NoctalEngine

Journey into making a personal 2D engine (initially).  
Once the engine is in a solid-state to start creating games, the goal is to use the engine as a learning environment to implement and refactor new systems needed for game ideas, as well as to create my own implementations of systems provided by third-party libraries.
- Plans to implement other rendering APIs (Likely D3D first, as I already have some experience with it). 
- Implementation of 3D rendering (etc) will likely be considered later in development.

- Largely influenced by TheCherno's Game Engine series (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxIZbV_XjAs&list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT&ab_channel=TheCherno)
- With some inspiration from ChilliTomatoNoodle's DirectX series (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4FArgOX1I4&list=PLqCJpWy5Fohd3S7ICFXwUomYW0Wv67pDD&ab_channel=ChiliTomatoNoodle)
